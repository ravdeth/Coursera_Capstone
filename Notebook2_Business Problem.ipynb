Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Italian restaurant** in **Berlin**, Germany.\n\nSince there are lots of restaurants in Berlin we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.8", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
